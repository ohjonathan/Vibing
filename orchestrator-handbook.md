> Generator Prompt + Workflow + Emergencies

## Generator Prompt

Copy this to your agentic CLI at the start of each session:

```
Read llm-development-playbook.md and session-variables.md.

Generate ready-to-paste prompts using the EXACT templates from the playbook. Do NOT modify, expand, or "improve" the prompts — use them VERBATIM. Fill in {{VARIABLES}} with values from session-variables.md.

Generate these prompts:
1. Architect
2. Critic — Standard (Claude)
3. Critic — Technical (Gemini)  
4. Critic — Adversarial (GPT)
5. Spec Consolidator
6. Architect Revision
7. Developer
8. Standard Reviewer
9. Adversarial Reviewer
10. Review Consolidator
11. Reality Sync (if version just shipped)

Output each prompt in a code block I can copy.
```

**What this does:** You input variables once → LLM outputs all prompts with your values filled in → you copy each to the appropriate model as needed.

**Why verbatim matters:** The prompts are carefully designed (adversarial framing, output formats, 300-word minimums, complexity audit FIRST). If the LLM "improves" them, constraints get softened.

## Workflow

```
You fill session-variables.md
    ↓
Generator Prompt → LLM outputs all prompts
    ↓
Copy Architect prompt → Get spec
    ↓
Copy 3 Critic prompts → Send IN PARALLEL (Claude, Gemini, GPT)
    ↓
Copy Consolidator prompt → Synthesize feedback
    ↓
Copy Architect Revision prompt → One revision
    ↓
★ GATE 1: Proceed to Development?
    ↓
Copy Developer prompt → Get PR
    ↓
Copy 2 Reviewer prompts → Send IN PARALLEL (Standard, Adversarial)
    ↓
Copy Review Consolidator prompt → Synthesize
    ↓
★ GATE 2: Merge?
    ↓
Copy Reality Sync prompt → Update Master Plan
```

**Handoffs:** 6-8 per feature
**Your decisions:** 2 gates
**Parallel steps:** Critics (3 models), Reviewers (2 models)

## The Two Gates

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GATE 1: PROCEED TO DEVELOPMENT?         │
│  After Architect revision                │
│  You've seen all critic feedback         │
│  You decide: build or clarify scope      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  GATE 2: MERGE?                          │
│  After review consolidation              │
│  You've seen complexity concerns         │
│  You decide: ship or address issues      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## One Revision Cap

If major issues persist after one revision:
- **Requirements unclear** → Fix requirements, don't iterate
- **Scope too large** → Split the feature
- **Fundamental disagreement** → You decide

More rounds don't fix these. They defer the problem.

---

## Role Monitoring

### Architect
**Watch for:** Scope creep, YAGNI violations
**Red flag:** "This will allow us to easily..."
**Action:** Send back — "Design for THIS version only"

### Developer
**Watch for:** Stuck loops, scope creep, ComplexityFlags
**Red flags:**
- "I'll also improve/refactor X" → Scope creep
- "Should I do X or Y?" → Spec was ambiguous
- 10+ file changes when spec mentioned 3 → Review before proceeding

**Handling ComplexityFlags:**
1. **Accept:** Use simpler alternative
2. **Override:** Cite specific PRD requirement
3. **Escalate:** Ask Architect to clarify

### Reviewers
**Watch for:** Rubber-stamp approvals
**Rule:** Side with Adversarial on complexity concerns

**Invalid Adversarial outputs (send back):**
- "Looks good" — Too vague
- Short review (<300 words) — Not thorough
- No complexity audit section

## Emergency Procedures

### E1: Developer Stuck in Loop
1. STOP immediately
2. Read the last 3 attempts yourself
3. Restart with: "Do NOT try [X] again. The issue is [Y]. Try [Z] instead."

### E2: Post-Merge Bug
1. REVERT immediately
2. Hotfix branch from last good commit
3. Fix → Single review → Merge

### E3: Security Vulnerability
1. Do NOT discuss in public
2. Assess severity
3. Document in private security log after fix

### E4: Developer Goes Rogue
1. STOP
2. `git diff` to see actual vs. expected
3. `git checkout` or `git revert`
4. Restart with constraint

### E5: Context Collapse
1. Do NOT continue
2. Use Context Refresh prompt from playbook
3. Correct or start fresh

### E6: Reviewers Approve Too Easily
1. Do NOT merge
2. Add new reviewer: "find something wrong"

### E7: ComplexityFlag Raised
1. READ the flag
2. Accept / Override / Escalate
3. Do NOT ignore

## Escalation Matrix

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Critics disagree | You decide on conflicts |
| Adversarial blocks, Standard approves | **Adversarial wins** |
| ComplexityFlag raised | Accept / Override / Escalate |
| Major issues after revision | Split scope or clarify requirements |

**Side with the pessimist.** Complexity is sticky; bugs are transient.

## Quality Checklist

### Before Development (Gate 1)
- [ ] Spec has Assumptions section
- [ ] Cut List exists
- [ ] Adversarial complexity concerns addressed
- [ ] No "future flexibility" speculation

### Before Merge (Gate 2)
- [ ] Adversarial review 300+ words
- [ ] Complexity audit completed
- [ ] No unresolved conflicts

---

## Quick Reference

### Key Rules
- **Parallel fan-out:** Send critics/reviewers simultaneously, don't wait
- **One revision cap:** If issues persist, scope is wrong
- **Side with pessimist:** Adversarial wins ties
- **ComplexityFlags are valid:** Developer can refuse

### Anti-Complexity Triggers
- "What breaks if we delete this?"
- "Show me 3 concrete uses for this abstraction"
- "What PRD requirement necessitates this?"
